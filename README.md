# Updated-Manacube-MCC
STEP 1: Download 'manacube-MCC' folder, Unzip it if required (i use 7Zip), then Right Click 'Start.bat'

STEP 2: Change the USERNAME and PASSWORD with ur alt, u can have up to 10 accounts logged in per IP to comlpy with manacube rules, so if running on ur home pc, 9 alts, 1 main

STEP 3: Save and Close 'Start.bat'

STEP 4: Edit 'MincraftClient.config, scroll all the way down to the bottom and find 'Script Scheduler' and change the server location to the location your alts will be, for example if the island(s) are on SB01, change it to '/server skyblock-islands-1'. 

STEP 5: That is really it, unless u have an alt(s) that requires logging in with Mojang instead of Microsoft, you can change this in the settings, which you can edit in 'MincraftClient.config'.
